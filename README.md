The program reads from the console a non-negative integer and checks whether this number is a base-10 Kaprekar number.
A number is called base-10 Kaprekar if the square representation of the number can be divided into two parts A and B such that they add up to the original number. Each segment can include zeros before the number, but while the A segment can be 0 the B must always be >0.
Example:

Number 9 is Kaprekar because 92 = 81 and 81 is divisiblein A = 8 and B = 1, where A+B = 9

Number 297 is Kaprekar because 2972 = 88209 and 88209 can be divided into
A = 88 and B = 209, where A+B = 297
